\begin{abstract}
Many innovative software engineering tools appear at the field's premier venues, the 
International Software Engineering Conference (ICSE) and the 
Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).
But what happens to these tools after they were presented?
In this paper, we spend 10,000 hours %update with real number 
trying to obtain, download, use, and repackage 150 %update
tools from ICSE and FSE's tool demonstration tracks.
Our results enumerate the practical and accidental reasons that
software engineering tools fail to work over time,
and provide practical implications for creating lasting tools.

\section{Introduction}

What tool demos are.
Why they're important.

Why it's important that they last.
- future work must built on past work
- one other way to figure out what those in the past did and learned

why its hard to get tools to last.
- no requirement for archiving tools
- shifting platforms
- data loss 
- implicit information

in this paper, we contribute:
- an evaluation of how difficult it is to get past tools working
- re-package existing tools with an eye towards maximizing durability (do we need a word?)

\section{Related Work}

Artifact evaluation committees. (SIGPLAN, where else?)

Other fields:
- Data science (doing better - http://zenodo.org)
- MPC journal requires code submission (tarball)
- In general, Math not doing a lot with code sub submissions
- Security, should be able to do VM, but don't (but see Will's paper)
- HPC doesn't (and maybe can't)
- RTC is starting to do it, but maybe shouldn't

Constant worry is protecting IP in security and HPC


\section{Research Questions}

Henceforth, we will simply say \textit{tool}
to refer to software engineering tools presented at
the International Conference on Software Engineering
or Foundations of Software Engineering in their
respective tool demonstration tracks.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item How much effort is required to get tools to work?
  \item What are the barriers to get tools to work?
  \item How much effort is required to get tools to work in virtual machines?
  \item What are the barriers to get tools to work in virtual machines?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Proceedure}

No cost, but demos ok. (How many did this happen with?)

Tools where tool could convievably be put into a virtual machine. How many didn't fit?

\section{Results}

\subsection{RQ1 and RQ2}

\subsubsection{Effort}

Average person-hours per tool, distribution (min, max, box plot)

Time invested in evaluating non-working tools.

\subsubsection{Challenge: Tool Cannot Be Obtained}

What percent of tool links were dead?
What percent of tools said they were available in the paper, but the tool could not be obtained?
What percent of tools were being planned to be commercialized? What were actually commercial?
What percent of tools could we use if we had paid for them?

\subsubsection{Challenge: Disappearing Tools}

One author said tool just doesn't exist anymore.

Another author had to dig tool out of long term archive.

Several authors (what percent?) has tools hosted on Google code, even though it was dying.
Did we save 'em?

\subsubsection{Challenge: Author non-responsive}

%TODO: look at righthand column for tool; indications of why tools not working?

\subsubsection{Challenge: Technical Difficulties}

\subsubsection{Challenge: Inconsistencies}

One tool required to different VMs because two features needed different prereqs.

Some tools versioned differently.

\subsection{RQ3 and RQ4}


\subsubsection{Challenge: Tool Licensing}

University grey area.

\subsubsection{Challenge: Technology Stack Licensing}

\subsubsection{Challenge: Author Doesn't Want Redistribution}

Even when tool is available

\section{Conclusions}
